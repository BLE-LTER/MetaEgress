# other tasks

refactor code
add journal article citations (already in lter-pkg-mgmt)
build spreadsheet with just PI columns with other columns hidden
add taxa

add lter core area (already in lter-pkg-mgmt)
add lat/lon constraint to include as least six decimal places as per BP?
R might be treating protocol description as protocol distribution (i.e., a URL)
If no subpath or urlhead, R is using filename as download link. Ah, this may be following old protocol of posting data on server for PASTA to harvest.
fundingSource is required according to BP but not included
metadataProvider is not included in output when entered as that role in db
orcid uses directory instead of system (BP), though R may be right in this case
are individualNames sorted by alpha as per BP? NO, it's done by authorship order.
externally defined format version doesn't make it into xml.

# Answered and all good

individual sampling sites returned when lats and lons are the same? Yes
non-rectangle polygons supported? No, archive a shapefile with your project instead.
